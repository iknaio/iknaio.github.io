Having discovered money flows of interest, the user can highlight entities and addresses individually by assigning colours to them (see Figure 14). The highlighting tool can be found in the toolbar in the top right as a pen icon. By clicking on it, a set of predefined colours appears. The user may now pick one of them and see the cursor turn into a crosshair when hovering over an entity or address. Simple clicking assigns the selected colour to the node. Edges between addresses/entities highlighted in the same colour are also drawn in the same colour.

Additionally, the user has the option to label colours by typing into the respective text field in the highlighting tool. The trash bin icon next to the text field leads to highlights of that colour being removed from the graph.
