Open source, collaboration, and co-creation are fundamental principles
that have driven the development of the [GraphSense Cryptoasset Analytics
platform](https://github.com/graphsense) over the years.

The inaugural GraphSense Connect Event is designed to further this vision,
aiming to connect users, developers, and stakeholders. It offers a dynamic
forum to discuss ongoing initiatives and to collaboratively determine the
future direction of the GraphSense platform.

This event is open to everyone interested, but
[registration](https://forms.gle/cZ3i8Aq6oyYYow4n9) is required.

The event is organized by the core developers of GraphSense and is scheduled
for November 9th, 2023, at the [Complexity Science Hub Vienna](https://csh.ac.at).
