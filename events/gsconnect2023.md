Open source, collaboration, and co-creation are fundamental principles
that have driven the development of the [GraphSense Cryptoasset Analytics
platform](https://github.com/graphsense) over the years.

The inaugural GraphSense Connect Event is designed to further this vision,
aiming to connect users, developers, and stakeholders. It offers a dynamic
forum to discuss ongoing initiatives and to collaboratively determine the
future direction of the GraphSense platform.

This event is open to everyone interested, but
registration is required.

## Afternoon session - Data sharing and Co-creation

In this session, we will focus on collaborative tagging, data sharing, and contributing to the
GraphSense code base in general. We will explain TagPacks, our standard format for organizing and sharing
attribution tags. We will also explain how one can become contributor to the system and how to create
customized extensions on top of GraphSense. Finally, we will lay out and openly discuss our feature
and release roadmap for the upcoming months.
