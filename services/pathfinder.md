# What is Pathfinder?

Iknaio Pathfinder is a powerful online service that allows you to easily analyze addresses and transactions in various cryptoasset networks such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Tether. The interface is intuitive, enabling you to follow the money on an individual transaction level as well as at an aggregated level, ensuring that they never lose sight of the bigger picture.

You can annotate your investigations by tagging addresses and highlighting relevant paths. This makes it easy to stay organized and focused. Investigations and tags can be exported and shared with others, making it simple to collaborate on complex projects.
Iknaio Pathfinder is based on the open source GraphSense Dashboard and provides additional advanced features such as collaborative investigations and automating information requests. This makes it an incredibly powerful tool for anyone looking to gain insights into payment flows or conduct investigations in the world of digital currencies.
