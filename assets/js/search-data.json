    "content": "We have a strong background in science and a passion for technology and see that some techniques used in cryptoassets could advance innovation in the financial sector. While we are enthusiastic about certain technologies used in cryptoassets, we are committed to preventing their misuse for illicit activities. We believe that it is essential to provide vetted authorities with the necessary tools to combat such activities efficiently. Furthermore, we recognize that sustainable growth and long-term trust in emerging technologies depend on a comprehensive understanding and management of risks. To this end, we must ensure that the high volatility and risk inherent in the crypto space do not negatively impact users in the traditional financial sector. This requires robust risk management protocols that can prevent any potential failures in the crypto market from spilling over and causing harm to users in more established financial systems. Therefore, our vision is to provide services that help authorities and businesses in understanding money flows in the cryptoasset ecosystem. We acknowledge that current investigation practices for cryptoassets have significant limitations. Response times are often slow due to the high cost and limited availability of specialized tools. Furthermore, investigators frequently find themselves working on the same cases without the benefit of knowledge sharing, which can lead to inefficiencies and redundancies. Finally, the highly complex nature of money laundering networks, which are often generated and controlled by machines, can make it challenging for investigators to follow the money manually. In our view, the best way to address these challenges is through the widespread availability of basic cryptoasset tracing tools and increased automation. By automating certain processes and enabling investigators to collaborate more effectively, we can improve response times and streamline investigations. As scientists, we understand that data sovereignty is an essential prerequisite for implementing effective and cost-efficient analytics workflows. In addition, we recognize that true comprehension of results is only achievable if the underlying data is both available and interpretable. These considerations are especially important when evidence resulting from cryptoasset investigations must be presented and defended in court or when reproducible facts are necessary for informed policy-making in the cryptoasset space. To ensure the highest level of transparency and accountability in our services, we have made a commitment to open-source software and detailed data provenance records. This approach ensures that our software is accessible to all and that our processed data points can be traced back to their original sources. We believe that this level of transparency is essential to building trust in the cryptoasset ecosystem and fostering a culture of responsible data use. Ultimately, our goal is to provide our clients with the tools and resources they need to make informed decisions based on accurate, reliable data. At the core of our philosophy is the concept of co-creation. We recognize that there is no one-size-fits-all solution to the complex challenges posed by cybercrime and the misuse of cryptoassets. Instead, we believe that the most effective tools are those that are highly specialized on solving a specific problem and, at the same time, open enough to be integrated into broader forensic workflows tailored to needs of investigators. Therefore, we advocate for public-private partnerships that bring together experts with diverse but complementary backgrounds. By collaborating and sharing expertise, we are developing additional product features and make them available to our customers. We believe that this approach is key to promoting innovation and advancing the fight against cybercrime and the abuse of cryptoassets. Our commitment to co-creation extends beyond the development of tools. We also support our customers in becoming more efficient and effective by implementing highly automized data-driven forensics, compliance, and reporting workflows. In summary, our vision is to streamline and automate cryptoasset investigations for our customers, by providing a user-friendly technology accessible from any desk, enabling them to access transparent information and make informed decisions. We aspire to empower everyone with the tools they need to navigate the complex world of cryptoassets. ",

After picking a file with the “.gs” extension from the user’s file system, the application will recreate it by first fetching the address/entity data from the GraphSense backend, then placing the nodes according to the stored state and finally fetching the edges between the nodes. This process may take a few seconds depending on how big the exported graph is, but it results in an up-to-date application state with the recently crawled ledger data.

    "doc": "Following the money",
    "title": "Following the money",
    "content": "Starting from a given focus address, the user can follow the money flows by clicking on the right- or left-hand side of an address. If the number of incoming- or outgoing addresses is lower than a certain threshold (25), then the dashboard automatically expands the connected addresses. If the number is higher and hard to visualise, it opens the address-detail view table and lets the user select which addresses to display on the dashboard. A directed edge between two addresses (see Figure 10) represents the aggregated money flow between them. The edge label can be configured (gear symbol) and either shows the aggregated sum of values transferred between two addresses or the aggregated number of involved transactions. By clicking on an edge, the user can inspect involved transactions in more detail and inspect their specific inputs and outputs. We point out that following the money flows on the address-level is a key feature for many blockchain and cryptoasset analytics tasks because it represents what an analyst is typically interested in: the flow of money between addresses. The underlying address-graph is the corresponding data representation required to support that kind of traversal. GraphSense supports the inspection of individual addresses but refrains from providing transaction-level tracing features since this is already supported by many openly available tools (e.g., Blockstream4 explorer). Analogous to following the money on the address-level, the user can also follow money starting from a given focus entity, i.e., a cluster of addresses. Just as the nodes represent aggregations of addresses, the edges in this graph represent aggregations of money flows. By clicking on an edge, the user can see detailed information about the data points contributing to this information. The example provided in Figure 11 shows a typical money laundering pattern: the perpetrator, who received funds from sextortion spam victims, spreads the funds over several intermediate wallets to make it difficult for authorities to trace the funds. We point out that inspecting money flows between entities/clusters can be highly effective because the investigator is presented with a highly aggregated view and can quickly identify potential connections without the need to inspect (lower-level) address flows or (lowest- level) transactions. However, we explicitly warn against following money flows on the cluster- level only if the underlying data points forming a cluster are unknown and might potentially comprise false positives. Therefore, GraphSense provides the combined address- and entity- level view, which allows the investigator to first follow the money on the entity level and then refine relevant paths on the address level. Since following individual money flows is a tedious and resource-intensive task, GraphSense also provides an automated path search feature (see Figure 12). By right-clicking on an entity box, the user can start a search for certain types (e.g., Exchange) of source or target nodes in both directions. Since the search space can be very large, the user must restrict the search to a certain depth (e.g., 4), breadth (e.g., 20), and maximum size of an address cluster (e.g., 20) hit during a search request. The dashboard then presents the results, as shown in Figure 13. ",

GraphSense is a cryptoasset analytics platform developed and hosted in Europe. It has been designed as an extensible and scalable data science platform for executing customised analytics tasks on data gathered from multiple blockchains and other contextually relevant off-chain sources, such as exchange rate services. Like other offerings, GraphSense provides a low-entry dashboard for investigating money flows. But, more importantly, it offers the flexibility to implement customised analytics procedures, either against an API or directly against the pre-computed network data sets, representing flows between addresses (address graph) and entities such as cryptoasset exchanges (entity graph). Furthermore, GraphSense introduces the notion of TagPacks, which support collaborative collection and provenance-aware curation of attribution tags, which de-anonymise real-world actors such as exchanges and are valuable data points in most analytics tasks.

The box shows the cryptocurrency that address is part of (BTC), the number of available attribution tags (2) for that address, the number of transactions that address has been involved (19) as a receiver of funds (17) and as a sender of funds (2). It also shows the number of addresses that sent funds to the focus address (29) and the number of addresses that received funds from the focus address (2). Additionally, it shows the first usage date of that address (11/02/2018), when it was used last (11/15/2018), and the corresponding usage period (approx. 13 days). Finally, it shows how much that address has received in total (1.5784 BTC) and the current balance of that address (0 BTC). Some of these statistics are aggregated and can be inspected in more detail by clicking the three-dot symbol next to each line. For instance, when clicking on the dots in the “Transactions” row, one can inspect the transactions this address has been involved in more detailed. The corresponding box on the dashboard displays the statistical properties of an address, which are important to understand when following the money flow, like the number of incoming (in-degree) and outgoing (out-degree) addresses. This specific example also shows a red-flash-light symbol indicating that this address has been involved in some form of abuse derived from the attribution tags. Analogous to addresses, GraphSense also provides statistical properties for transactions and blocks. Using the gear symbol in the top-right menu bar (see Figure 6), the user can configure view settings, like the type of information displayed on the dashboard. Most importantly, the user can change the type of currency (native coin vs fiat values) and convert all values in the property boxes and the dashboard considering historical exchange rates.

    "content": "In UTXO ledgers, a user can create and control an arbitrary number of addresses at no cost. Linking and clustering these addresses into a single set representing the real-world entity that likely controls these addresses is an essential task in cryptoasset analytics. GraphSense currently implements the co-spent heuristics, which is also known as multiple-input heuristics and assumes that inputs spent in the same transactions are controlled by the same user who must possess the corresponding private key for signing these inputs. While this method has proved very effective in practice, a known, possible source for false positives are CoinJoins, which can be identified and filtered before applying those heuristics. Other known clustering heuristics rely on the identification of change addresses in the transaction outputs. However, since this depends on the technical nature of the client executing the transactions, GraphSense refrains from implementing any change heuristics and follows a very conservative clustering strategy and applies the multiple-input heuristics only. The underlying rationale is the avoidance of false positives, which we consider more important than implementing multiple but possibly ineffective heuristics. Using the dashboard, the user can also inspect an address cluster, which is called an “entity” in GraphSense (see Figure 7). Since entities are essentially aggregations of addresses (see Figure 8), the statistical properties for entities correspond to those seen on the address-level, just on an aggregate level. Additionally, the user sees a GraphSense-internal entity ID and the root address of an entity, which is the oldest address within an address cluster. This information is useful when comparing entities or address clusters across tools. TODO: add video . ",

The strength of the attribution approach lies in combining address clusters with attribution tags: a tag attributed to a single address being controlled by some cryptoasset service, which typically forms a large address cluster, can easily de-anonymise hundreds of thousands of addresses. Given the important role of attribution tags, GraphSense follows key legal requirements for forensic data processing, as outlined3 by legal scholars and technical experts in the field. The provenance of attribution tags, for instance, is a critical foundation for assessing their quality and authenticity, as well as for enabling trust and allowing reproducibility. Users can inspect the provenance (origin) and additional metadata of attribution tags by opening the corresponding “address tags” detail view. Figure 9, for instance, shows that the attribution tags labelling the given cluster originate from a scientific study on sextortion campaigns, which can be retrieved by following the provided source link.

It is essential to know that GraphSense can support any Bitcoin-like UTXO ledger and any Ethereum-like account model ledger and that additional ledgers can easily be integrated if needed, typically on (customer-)demand. The ledger statistics page shows, for each ledger, the last update date and latest block, the number of transactions and addresses as well as the number of distinct labels (considering clustering in UTXO), and the overall percentage of de-anonymised addresses. GraphSense release 22.11 currently provides daily updates, whereas tighter update intervals can be configured when requested by the customer.v . It is important to know that generic clustering techniques, as they are implemented for UTXO ledgers like Bitcoin, cannot be applied to account-model ledgers like Ethereum. Therefore, the number of entities (clusters) in Ethereum is zero. TODO: add screenshot of statistics page . ",
