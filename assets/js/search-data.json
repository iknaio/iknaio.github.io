    "content": "Demand for cryptoasset analysis tools is increasing: businesses dealing with cryptoassets analyse transactions to fulfil compliance guidelines and regulations; law enforcement needs these techniques to track and trace illicit money flows; designers of distributed ledger technology analyse deployed systems to make informed system design decisions; finally, analysts in businesses and authorities must analyse transactional data to understand markets and capital market flows between significant players on the market. GraphSense is a cryptoasset analytics platform developed and hosted in Europe. It has been designed as an extensible and scalable data science platform for executing customised analytics tasks on data gathered from multiple blockchains and other contextually relevant off-chain sources, such as exchange rate services. Like other offerings, GraphSense provides a low-entry dashboard for investigating money flows. But, more importantly, it offers the flexibility to implement customised analytics procedures, either against an API or directly against the pre-computed network data sets, representing flows between addresses (address graph) and entities such as cryptoasset exchanges (entity graph). Furthermore, GraphSense introduces the notion of TagPacks, which support collaborative collection and provenance-aware curation of attribution tags, which de-anonymise real-world actors such as exchanges and are valuable data points in most analytics tasks.
