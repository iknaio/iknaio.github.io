<h6 id="13-newsletter">1.3 Newsletter</h6>

<p>(a) Type and extent of data processing : You may subscribe to our newsletter via the Website. To do so, you must provide your email address. The newsletter provides you with news about our company and services; it will solely be sent to email addresses having been indicated by interested users themselves. If you no longer wish to receive the newsletter, you can of course unsubscribe at any time by clicking on the button to unsubscribe at the end of each newsletter or by notifying us of your wish via the contact address specified on our Website and on the front page of this Data Protection Declaration. We also use the newsletter for statistical evaluations in connection with your personal data and assess the performance of the newsletter by analysing opening and click behaviour as well as information on the technical deliverability of the newsletter.</p>

<p>For delivery of the newsletter, we use the newsletter service “ <strong>Mailchimp</strong> “, which is operated by The Rocket Science Group LLC d/b/a Mailchimp, 675 Ponce de Leon Ave NE, Suite 5000, Atlanta, GA 30308 USA. Hence, your voluntarily provided data will be saved on servers of The Rocket Science Group LLC; in particular, that might entail a processing of your data in the USA.

<h5 id="2-storage-and-tracking-technologies">2. Storage and tracking technologies</h5>

<h6 id="21-cookies">2.1 Cookies</h6>

<p>If you give us your express consent pursuant to Art6para1litaGDPR, so-called “cookies” are used on our Website (you may withdraw you previously given consent at any time [see “right to withdraw” under clause4]); in case you decline to provide us with your consent, we shall limit our use of cookies to those cookies being technically necessary and essential for the proper functioning of our Website (seebelow) and process your data on the basis of our accompanying legitimate interest (Art6para1litfGDPR), as far as personal data are involved.</p>

<p>Cookies are small data sets that are stored and managed on your end device by your browser. They help us to make our offer more user-friendly. They are placed by a web server and sent back to it as soon as a new connection is established in order to recognize the user and his settings. In this sense, a cookie is a small local text file that assigns a specific identity consisting of numbers and letters to your end device.</p>

<p>In most cases, cookies do not contain personal data. Furthermore, cookies cannot access or interact with data stored locally on your device under any circumstances. For example, cookies can enable you to access and navigate websites faster and more efficiently. Cookies help to maintain the functionality of websites with regard to state of the art functions and user experience (eg by saving the resolution of a requesting device so that a website can be displayed correctly); on the other hand, they are also used for targeted and cost-saving marketing measures. Moreover, we use cookies to personalize contents and ads, offer social media features and analyses traffic on our website. Furthermore, we share information regarding your interaction with our website with our partners for social media, advertisement and analytics. Our respective partners may combine this data with other sets of data that have either been provided by you or collected in the course of the use of their services. Cookies that are stored on your end device due to your visit of our Website can be set either directly by us or by third parties who provide services for us (third-party cookies). The actual content of a specific cookie is always determined by the website that created it.</p>

<p>Cookies always contain the following information:</p>

<p>– name of the cookie;</p>

<p>– name of the server the cookie originates from;</p>

<p>– ID number of the cookie;</p>

<p>– an end date at the end of which the cookie is automatically deleted.</p>

<p>Cookies can be differentiated according to type and purpose as follows:</p>

<p>– Necessary/essential cookies : Such cookies are required for the operation of the Website and are essential to navigate the Website and to use its full range of functions (eg to access protected areas of the digital appearance). Without these cookies, Websites cannot function properly on many occasions. Furthermore, – from a legal point of view – all cookies which are absolutely necessary for us for other reasons in order to be able to provide our services, may be categorized essential if the respective services were expressly requested by you. Necessary cookies are always first-party cookies. They can only be deactivated in the settings of your browser by rejecting all cookies without exception (see below) and are also used on our Website legally permissible without obtaining prior consent .</p>

<p>– Functionality cookies : These cookies allow websites to remember information that affects the way a website behaves or looks, like preferences in the language settings or the geographical region from which the website is accessed.</p>

<p>– Performance cookies : These types of cookies allow website operators to understand how visitors interact with their website by collecting and analyzing information about user behavior anonymously. In particular, the following information may be stored: (i) accessed sub-pages (duration and frequency); (ii) order of pages visited; (iii) search terms used having led to the visit of the respective website; (iv) mouse movements (scrolling and clicking); (v) country and region of access. These cookies allow to determine what a user is interested in and thereby adapt the content and functionality of the website to individual user needs.</p>

<p>– Tracking cookies : These cookies allow tracking of visitors when accessing Websites. The intention behind this is to display advertisements that are relevant and appealing to the respective user and therefore have more value for the publisher and the third-party advertiser. This can be achieved by analyzing user behavior and display of personalized advertising based on the interests determined. Among other things, they collect information about previously visited websites. If you consent to the placement of these cookies, tracking cookies may be placed on your device as specified in the cookie consent tool and our cookie description.</p>

<p>With regard to the storage period cookies can be further differentiated as follows:</p>

<p>– Session cookies : Such cookies will be deleted without any action on your part as soon as you close your current browser session. Such cookies, for example, allow you to remain logged in to your password-protected customer account during navigation on websites by assigning you a specific session ID.</p>

<p>– Persistent cookies : Such cookies (eg to save your language settings) remain stored on your end device until a previously defined expiration date or until you have them manually removed. Among other things, they enable cross-session user tracking.</p>

<p>Furthermore, cookies may be differentiated by their subject of attribution :</p>

<p>– First-party cookies : Such cookies are used by ourselves and placed directly from our Website. Browsers generally do not make them accessible across domains which is why the user can only be recognized by the page from which the cookie originates.</p>

<p>– Third-party cookies : Such cookies are not placed by the website operator itself, but by third parties when visiting a specific Website, in particular, for advertising purposes (eg to track surfing behavior). They allow, for example, to evaluate different page views as well as their frequency.</p>

<p>Most browsers automatically accept cookies. However, you have the option to customize your browser settings so that cookies are either generally declined or only allowed in certain ways (eg, limiting refusal to third party cookies). However, if you change your browser’s cookie settings, our Website may no longer be fully usable. Via your browser you furthermore have the possibility to delete all cookies saved on your end device, which is equal to a withdrawal of your consent.</p>

<h6 id="22-localsession-storage">2.2 Local/session storage</h6>

<p>If you have given us your explicit prior consent according to Art6para1litaGDPR after accessing our Website, we use storage capacity of your browser software in order to enhance the usability of our Website, its user-friendliness and our service in general (for example to save your language settings). Therefore, we use the so-called local/session storage to store certain data on your end device, whereby your browser software maintains a separate local/session storage for each domain. Besides yourself, only we are able to access the data we are processing in this context. Under no circumstances, third parties/websites will be able to access any of such data; however, such data may be saved on our account by our partners (third party providers) on your end device. In contrast to “cookies”, this method is safer and faster because data are not transferred automatically to the respective server with every HTTP request, but stored by your browser software. Additionally, a greater volume of data (at least 5 megabytes) can be stored compared to cookies (a maximum of 4096 bytes).</p>

<p>Since functionalities are similar to cookies, please consider the information under clause 2.1. Further, please be aware that local storage data has no expiry date and will remain on your end device even after you have closed your browser session (similar to persistent cookies). Data in the session storage however only remains stored for the duration of the respective browser session (similar to session cookies).</p>

<p>Manually removing data from local storage or session storage works within the settings of most browsers in exactly the same way as manually removing cookies, since cookies are usually combined with other website data within this option (e.g. “Cookies and other website data”); in this respect, reference is made to the explanations under point 2.1. If the browser software you are using summarizes cookies and other website data in this way, blocking cookies also blocks access to the local storage or session storage (which can also lead to restrictions on the use of our Website). If you deactivate JavaScript, the local storage or session storage can no longer be used by us either, but this can generally lead to considerable restrictions on use.</p>

<h6 id="23-tracking-pixel">2.3 Tracking pixel</h6>

<p>We also use so-called tracking pixels (also: pixel tags or web beacons) to collect certain data via our Website. Tracking pixels are transparent images which are practically invisible as they consist of a single pixel. The tracking pixel is placed on a server and loaded therefrom as soon as a respective subpage of our Website is accessed. On our Website, tracking pixels are solely used by third parties contracted by us to provide certain services. They allow us to track that a subpage is accessed as well as any subsequent user activity on this page. By means of the tracking pixel, in particular, the following information can be collected: (i) operating system used; (ii) browser type/version used; (iii) time of access; (iv) user behaviour on the visited page; (v) IP address and approximate location of the user.</p>

<p>Tracking pixels are used on our Website on the basis of our legitimate interest (Art6Abs1litfGDPR) in analysing user accesses in a state of the art manner. As a tracking pixel is merely an image loaded from a server, its lifetime is limited to your current browser session. However, information collected via a tracking pixel may be subsequently stored in cookies (seeclause3.1).</p>

<h5 id="3-third-party-services">3. Third-party services</h5>

<h6 id="31-google-analytics">3.1 Google Analytics</h6>

<p>Our Website uses a web analysis and online marketing tool of Google Ireland Limited, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland (“ <strong>Google</strong> <strong>Ireland</strong> “), namely “ <strong>Google Analytics</strong> “, which enables us to analyses how you use this Website (eg the time you spend on a subpage of our Website or which link are being clicked). Tracking is performed via the JavaScript library analytics.js provided by Google Ireland. Google Analytics uses first-party cookies, which may be stored on your end device after consenting accordingly. In respect of Google Analytics, Google Ireland acts as our processor in the sense of Art28GDPR.</p>

<p>In the context of the application of Google Analytics, your IP address as well as other client data, namely information about your use of our Website, for example, browser type/version, operating system, the previously visited website or the time of the server request, are transferred to and stored on Google servers. Based on our instructions, Google Ireland will use the information collected to analyse the use of our Website, draft reports on website activities and provide us with further services connected to the use of our Website and the Internet. The data concerning the use of our Website are deleted automatically after the retention period of fourteen (14) months, which we provided for, has expired.</p>

<p>The IP address transferred by your browser in the context of Google Analytics is not merged with other Google data. In order to protect you as comprehensively as possible, we utilise IP anonymization by extending the code of our Website by “anonymizeIP”. This ensures masking of your IP address, wherefore all data concerned are collected anonymously. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transferred to a Google server and shortened there.</p>

<p>Google Ireland intends to process data of users of the European Economic Area, where possible, in data centres situated in Europe; however, an outsourcing of processing activities to group companies may take place, wherefore a processing of your data in the USA by Google Ireland’s parent company Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA (“ <strong>Google LLC</strong> “) is possible. Any potential transfer or your data by Google Ireland to such sub-processors in third countries is based on the standard data protection clauses of the European Commission in the meaning of Art 46 sub-para 2 lit c GDPR. An overview of Google Ireland’s respectively Google LLC’s data centres can be viewed at: <a href="https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/inside/locations/?hl=en">https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/inside/locations/?hl=en</a> .</p>

<p>With the procedure described under point 2.1 you can prevent the storage of cookies by a corresponding setting of your browser software (possibly limited to third party cookies). You can also prevent Google Ireland from collecting data generated by cookies and relating to your use of the Website (including your IP address) and from processing this data by downloading an appropriate browser plug-in (available for Microsoft Internet Explorer 11, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari and Opera) and installing it ( <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en</a> ).</p>

<p>For further information on data usage by Google Ireland and affiliated companies as well as your options in terms of settings and objection, please review the data protection declaration of Google at <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en">https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en</a> .</p>

<h6 id="32-links-to-third-party-sites">3.2 Links to third-party sites</h6>

These are, in particular, reference links leading to our permanent partners as well as links to our presences in social networks (eg Facebook).

Accordingly, we refer you, in general, to the separate privacy policies of these websites.

<h5 id="4-social-media-presences">4. Social media presences</h5>

<p>For the purpose of promoting our business activity and our service offer, we maintain presences in various social networks. The processing of your data in this context is based on our legitimate interest (Art6para1litfGDPR) in expanding our reach as well as providing additional information and means of communication to users of social networks. In order to reach said purposes at the best possible rate, we may utilise functions provided by the respective service provider to measure our reach in detail (access statistics, identification of returning users, etc).</p>

<p>In the course of accessing any of the online presences outlined subsequently, we process the general information being evident due to your profile in the respective network as well as additional continuance, contact or content data, as far as you provide us with such data by interacting with our online presence and its contents. We do not store those data separately outside of the respective social network.</p>

<p>Since we jointly decide with the relevant service provider (respectively entity expressly outlined as controller) upon purposes and means of data processing in the course of a respective online presence, we are to be considered joint controllers in the sense of Art26GDPR. The provider of each social network mentioned shall act as the primary point of contact with regard to all general and technical questions in respect of our online presences; this also applies to fulfilling rights of the data subjects in the sense of point 5. However, in case of requests concerning the specific operation of our online presences, your interactions with them or information published/collected via such channels, we shall be the primary point of contact; point 5 as well as other stipulations in this Data Protection Declaration apply correspondingly.</p>
