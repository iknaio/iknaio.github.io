<p>
Founded in 2021, Iknaio provides operational services around the open-source analytics platform GraphSense. It consists of an API for highly efficient forensic tasks and an interactive dashboard that allows users to visualize and understand cryptoasset flows. All services are hosted in Europe. Iknaio offers these services to investigators from national authorities, law enforcement agencies, security companies, and the payment industry to help them uncover and trace criminally relevant crypto-based transactions in detail. Iknaio also offers several customer-specific extensions built on top of GraphSense.
