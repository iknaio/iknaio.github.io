The German Startup Cup was initiated by the nonprofit association GFFT e.V. to strengthen innovation and support young companies in establishing themselves in the market. Startups are integrated into the United Innovations network, where they have the opportunity to showcase their innovations to interested user companies and a panel of experts.

The focus is on exchanging ideas with experts on current IT-related topics and challenges. Young companies provide insights with their pitches and present new solutions. At the same time, they engage in direct contact and benefit from the expertise of the jury.

Iknaio has been honored with the second place in the category Fintech.
