The [Bank of International Settlements (BIS)](https://bis.org/) and its partners within the Eurosystem, released a [report](https://www.bis.org/publ/othp76.htm) describing first results of [Project ATLAS](https://www.bis.org/about/bisih/topics/suptech_regtech/atlas.htm). The project focuses on focusing on international flows of cryptoassets and combines data gathered from crypto exchanges with granular data extracted from public blockchains.

A significant observation from this report is: ***Even though blockchain data are openly available, methodologies for data aggregation are often a black box, preventing researchers from engaging in deep-dive analysis and regulators from benchmarking data across sources***

Iknaio is proud to support this initiative. In our pursuit of transparency and accountability, we are firmly committed to open-source software and maintaining meticulous data provenance records. Such a stance ensures our software remains universally accessible and that each processed data point can be referenced back to its original source. Our primary objective is to equip our clients with the tools and knowledge they require to base their decisions on accurate and dependable data.
