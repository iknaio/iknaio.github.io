Iknaio is pleased to collaborate as an SME partner with the KIRAS DeFiTrace project. This project is focused on developing algorithmic methods to identify illegal transactions within Decentralized Finance (DeFi) systems, which operate across various ledgers. Our contribution will involve devising innovative analytics approaches and providing both data and processing resources.

The [Complexity Science Hub Vienna (CSH)](https://csh.ac.at) coordinates DeFiTrace, with additional support from the [University of Innsbruck](https://uibk.ac.at), as well as the Data Science and Artificial Intelligence group at the [AIT Austrian Institute of Technology](https://ait.ac.at). We are also delighted to see involvement from a diverse group of stakeholders, including the Austrian Federal Ministry of Interior, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Justice, the Financial Market Authority, the Austrian Central Bank, and the Bavarian Central Office for the Prosecution of Cybercrime.
