We are pleased to announce the release of GraphSense v24.01.

This update introduces tracing and tracking functionalities for the [Tron network](https://tron.network/) to the [GraphSense Cryptoasset Analytics](https://graphsense.org/) platform.

The enhancement includes monitoring capabilities for TRX, the primary currency of the Tron network, and extends comprehensive support to popular tokens such as USDT, USDC, and WTRX. This development reflects our dedication to broadening the scope of the GraphSense platform and addressing the most pertinent digital assets.
