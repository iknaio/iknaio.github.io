Date: Date: May 1st, 2022

The field of cryptoassets is witnessing rapid growth and it is imperative that research keeps pace with ongoing developments. However, it is equally apparent that the outcomes of such research are, at best, prototypes and not yet market-ready. To move to higher technology readiness levels, expert support is crucial, and that is where companies come into the picture.

In light of this, the Complexity Science Hub Vienna has entered into an agreement that seeks to propel the field of cryptoasset analytics to new heights by blending scientific excellence with an entrepreneurial spirit. This strategic partnership is geared towards advancing the state of the art in this field, thus enabling researchers and industry experts to keep abreast of the latest developments and innovations.
