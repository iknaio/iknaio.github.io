title: New study on case connections
image: assets/news/APWG-connecting-cases.jpg
excerpt: "We published a study in collaboration with the Bavarian Central Office for the Prosecution of Cybercrime (ZCB) showing that more than 40% of cybertrading fraud and more than 98% of sextortion cases are linked. These numbers clearly show the need for a broadly adopted case management system."

We just presented our recent study titled ***Increasing the Efficiency of Cryptoasset Investigations by Connecting the Cases*** at the [APWG Symposium on Electronic Crime Research](https://apwg.org/event/ecrime2023/) in Barcelona. This research was conducted in partnership with the Bavarian Central Office for the Prosecution of Cybercrime (ZCB).

Some key findings and take aways from our study:

- Cryptoasset-related crimes has resulted in a surge of cases. Victim losses amounting to 250 million Euros in 2022 and are estimated to be in the billions in Germany alone.

- We analyzed 34 cyberfraud and 1793 sextortion spam cases and found that 41% of the cyberfraud and 96.9% of the sextortion spam incidents are interconnected.

- We propose a simple, yet effective solution that allows investigators to identify connections between cases.

- We show that recognizing case connections can lead to remarkable efficiencies, especially when extended across crime areas, international borders, and jurisdictions.

For those interested in the details, a pre-print of our research is available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08205).
