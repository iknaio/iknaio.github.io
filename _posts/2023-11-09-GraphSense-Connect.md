On Nov. 9th, the [Complexity Science Hub Vienna](https://csh.ac.at) hosted our first [GraphSense Connect meeting](https://www.ikna.io/events/gsconnect2023.html).

Open source, collaboration, and co-creation are fundamental principles that have driven the development of the [GraphSense Cryptoasset Analytics platform](https://graphsense.org) over the years.

The the goal of that event was to further this vision, aiming to connect users, developers, and stakeholders. It offers a dynamic forum to discuss ongoing initiatives and to collaboratively determine the future direction of the GraphSense platform.

The entire GraphSense core development team, along with users and stakeholders from all core partners, were in Vienna, contributing to the success of this great event.

Given the success, we will certainly organize GraphSense Connect 2024.
