The award for the best startup went to Iknaio. The Vienna-based startup, launched in 2021, specializes in blockchain forensics with its open-source analysis platform GraphSense. The startup's technology is used by law enforcement agencies and security companies, among others. Iknaio was recognized for its "Cross Ledger Technology" – a new project by the company that focuses on tracking payment flows across ledgers."
