Before users can use the GraphSense dashboard or the API, they must obtain an API key from the entity hosting that service, in this case, Iknaio Cryptoasset Analytics GmbH.

For individual users, API keys can be requested at: https://ikna.io
For institutional users, API keys can be automatically distributed to a list of provided user email addresses.

After obtaining an API key, they can access the dashboard and the API.

TODO: add video showing how to use the API key
