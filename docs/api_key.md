To access the GraphSense dashboard or API, users need an API key from Iknaio Cryptoasset Analytics GmbH. 

Individual users can request keys [here](https://www.ikna.io/#packages), while institutional users receive them automatically via provided email addresses.

After obtaining an API key, users can access the Iknaio Pathfinder and Automator.
