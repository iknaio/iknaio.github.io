After having selected an address, the user sees that address (the focus address) on the dashboard and a property box summarising the most important statistical properties, as shown in Figure 5. The box shows the cryptocurrency that address is part of (BTC), the number of available attribution tags (2) for that address, the number of transactions that address has been involved (19) as a receiver of funds (17) and as a sender of funds (2). It also shows the number of addresses that sent funds to the focus address (29) and the number of addresses that received funds from the focus address (2). Additionally, it shows the first usage date of that address (11/02/2018), when it was used last (11/15/2018), and the corresponding usage period (approx. 13 days). Finally, it shows how much that address has received in total (1.5784 BTC) and the current balance of that address (0 BTC).

Some of these statistics are aggregated and can be inspected in more detail by clicking the three-dot symbol next to each line. For instance, when clicking on the dots in the “Transactions” row, one can inspect the transactions this address has been involved in more detailed.

The corresponding box on the dashboard displays the statistical properties of an address, which are important to understand when following the money flow, like the number of incoming (in-degree) and outgoing (out-degree) addresses. This specific example also shows a red-flash-light symbol indicating that this address has been involved in some form of abuse derived from the attribution tags.

Analogous to addresses, GraphSense also provides statistical properties for transactions and blocks.

Using the gear symbol in the top-right menu bar (see Figure 6), the user can configure view settings, like the type of information displayed on the dashboard. Most importantly, the user can change the type of currency (native coin vs fiat values) and convert all values in the property boxes and the dashboard considering historical exchange rates. It is also possible to switch the information displayed on address nodes and edges representing money flows (value vs the number of transactions).
