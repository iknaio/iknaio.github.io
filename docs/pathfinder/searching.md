When using the GraphSense dashboard, users typically want to search for a given address, a given transaction, a particular label (e.g., Kraken, Binance, Coinbase), or a certain block. The user can enter the leading characters of an address (e.g., 17vzpL...) and GraphSense returns matching addresses found in the corresponding ledgers. The user can select the address to be inspected further.

Autocompletion of user queries is also supported for transactions, labels, and blocks. Users can also enter multiple, whitespace-separated addresses in a row to inspect sets of addresses or money flow paths.
