Attribution tags are any form of context information that can be attributed to an address, transaction, or cluster, such as the name of an exchange hosting the associated wallet or some other personally identifiable information (PII) of the account holder. The strength of the attribution approach lies in combining address clusters with attribution tags: a tag attributed to a single address being controlled by some cryptoasset service, which typically forms a large address cluster, can easily de-anonymise hundreds of thousands of addresses.

Given the important role of attribution tags, GraphSense follows key legal requirements for forensic data processing, as outlined3 by legal scholars and technical experts in the field. The provenance of attribution tags, for instance, is a critical foundation for assessing their quality and authenticity, as well as for enabling trust and allowing reproducibility.

Users can inspect the provenance (origin) and additional metadata of attribution tags by opening the corresponding “address tags” detail view. Figure 9, for instance, shows that the attribution tags labelling the given cluster originate from a scientific study on sextortion campaigns, which can be retrieved by following the provided source link.
